# Predictive Modelling of Taxi Fares in NYC Overview
The project uses a multiple linear regression model to

### Problem
How do we effectively predict taxi cab fares prior to the ride? what are the responsible variables that successfully predict taxi cab fares?

### Objective
Estimate taxi cab fares prior to the ride.

### Data Understanding
The data comes from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2017-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/biws-g3hs">open data</a>. The data that we use consists of 22.7k data points and 18 variables. The variables included information on trip duration and distance, vendor used, fare amount, and payment type. The scatterplot shows that the fare amount is positvely correlated to the trip duration.
